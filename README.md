## NOTE

**1. The default password:** `123456`

**2. Remember to read the entire README.md**

## Features

- **Add a powerful security layer to your browser.**
Enhance your browserâ€™s protection with an extra shield that keeps your data safe from unauthorized access. The browser is automatically locked on every new login, ensuring that only you â€” or someone with the correct password â€” can use it.

- **Prevent unwanted access at all times.**
When the browser is locked, users are completely restricted from opening new tabs or accessing any websites except internal pages like `chrome://`. This creates a secure environment that blocks prying eyes and potential misuse right from the start.

- **Enjoy quick and seamless login** â€” just enter your password and you're instantly back to browsing. Itâ€™s designed to be fast, responsive, and effortless.

- **The interface is simple, clean, and user-friendly**, built with ease of use in mind. No complex settings or confusing menus â€” just install it once, and your browser is protected every time it starts.
