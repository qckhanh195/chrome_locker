## NOTE

**1. The default password:** `123456` . How to access the extension's Options page — **[change password](#options)**.

**2. Please make sure to read the entire contents of the README.md file — the most important part is the [Limitations](#limitations) section. :DD**

## Features

- **Add a powerful security layer to your browser.**
Enhance your browser’s protection with an extra shield that keeps your data safe from unauthorized access. The browser is automatically locked on every new login, ensuring that only you — or someone with the correct password — can use it.

- **Prevent unwanted access at all times.**
When the browser is locked, users are completely restricted from opening new tabs or accessing any websites except internal pages like `chrome://`. This creates a secure environment that blocks prying eyes and potential misuse right from the start.

- **Enjoy quick and seamless login** — just enter your password and you're instantly back to browsing. It’s designed to be fast, responsive, and effortless.

- **The interface is simple, clean, and user-friendly**, built with ease of use in mind. No complex settings or confusing menus — just install it once, and your browser is protected every time it starts.

> These limitations are partly due to changes from Manifest V2 to V3, so I haven't been able to fully resolve them yet :v

**Password:**

- No "forgot password" feature yet


**There may also be some other limitations, but we haven’t discovered them yet :DD**
